    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            UTILIZING MACHINE LEARNING FOR FACE MASK DETECTION. <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>The project's main goal is to follow the WHO's recommendations to stop the spread of Covid-19 and to compare the accuracy of various machine learning algorithms. Pre-processing, data augmentation, training, testing, and image segmentation are some of the processes that go into accomplishing the project's goal. Following the procedures, a segmented image of the input dataset of individuals wearing masks and those not wearing them will be obtained with the aid of the Mask R-CNN algorithm. The model is then put into practice using a webcam to produce results for individuals wearing masks and those who are not, along with a percentage of accuracy. Creating a model that can identify individuals who are not wearing masks in public areas is the goal of this project. <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>Tools and Technologies: Raspberry pi 3B, Python. <br><br>
                </li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>TO DESIGN A HIGH-FREQUENCY TRANSFORMER FOR SOLAR POWER APPLICATIONS. <br> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>            A MATLAB application for the evaluation of the design parameters has been introduced into the transformer design process. This approach decreases production costs and time while increasing accuracy when compared to manually calculated quantities. A 3D model is created using Solidworks and AutoCAD using the previously determined parameters. <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>            Tools and Technologies: MATLAB, Solidworks, AutoCAD. <br> <br>
                </li>
            </ul>

            </li>
        <li>
            COMATOSE PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM. <br> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The main objective of the project was to monitor the coma patient’s health in real time without the help of any caretaker. Various parameters such as temperature, humidity, pulse rate, urine level in the tank and eye movement were monitored. The collected data was uploaded to a cloud and displayed in a dashboard. <br> <br>
